# Find similar items (movies)
# You can store these data and refer back to it without needing to recompute
# So use the items dictionary to get similarities
# Intuition:
#   For movies that you haven't seen, you take the similarity (correlation
#     if use Pearson) between the unseen movie and one you have seen, then
#     multiply your rating of the one you've seen by the correlation.
#   So You see Snakes, rate it 4.5; there's a 0.182 similarity between
#     Snakes and Night, so your 'rating' for Night is 4.5*0.182 = 0.819.
#   Then, you multiply your rating * the similarity for the other movies
#     you've seen. Sum the total similarity and the total 'ratings' and
#     divide the 'ratings' by the similarity to normalize.
#   I think the takeaway is that you can predict values if you have some
#     'preferences' and similarity between your preferences and items you
#     haven't rated.
itemsim = recommendations.calculateSimilarItems(recommendations.critics)

# Suggest items based on predicted values
# So make a list of movies that Toby hasn't seen based on what he has seen
#   and the similarity between what he has seen and what he hasn't seen
recommendations.getRecommendedItems(recommendations.critics, itemsim, 'Toby')

# MovieLens data
# Interest in u.item and u.data from the zip file
