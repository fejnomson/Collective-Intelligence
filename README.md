Storing code written while working through O'Reilly Collective Intelligence book (in Python).

Working directory for all scripts and data is here. Not sure if this
  won't work for some reason (e.g. can't call from command line).

'<main working directory, not posting it to the public>/My Documents/PythonTemp'
